                    If you don't live under a rock, there is a slight chance you might have heard about or even held in the palm of your hand what is considered
                    one of the most famous puzzles of all times: the allmighty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube" class="contentLink"> Rubik's cube</a>,
                    invented and engeneered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ern%C5%91_Rubik" class="contentLink"> Ern≈ë Rubik</a>. Since his first creation, many
                    other kinds of cubes have followed, partially produced by the mastermind himself, whereas the rest's designs and engeneering befit the immense
                    fanbase which hasn't stopped growing ever since. Even though "definitely not being a Rubik's", this project is a further addition to this pile of
                    cubes, with the significant difference that the promoted cubes are fully virtual ones, embedded in an appealing and intuitive graphical interface.
                    It features a multitude of scrambable and solvable Rubik's cubes, such as the standard 3x3 or 4x4, as well as a lot of other practical (and only
                    soon to be coming) functions (for more information see <a href="#overview" class="contentLink"> this</a> section further below). It offers functionalities for both
                    beginners and professional competitors, meaning that both a learn and a competition mode are included.

                <p>
                    This project's main purpose was to offer beginners a costless, compact but exhaustive introduction to the magical world of Rubik's cubes, providing
                    them with several models as well as a set of algorithms to help them grasp the cubes' mechanisms. In addition, it is equipped with certain extremely
                    pratical functionalities, such as the "go a step back" option, which are helpful and otherwise non-existant.

                    <br/>
                    Aside from that, it provides some use to more advanced people, whereby this is more or less restricted to some very limited fun time with the cubes
                    and the usage of the set of algorithms as a way of looking them up quickly. As a more advanced cuber myself, I can say that it is a lot of fun
                    solving a cube in such an unusual way, but that on the other hand it simply can't keep up with a real, physical one you have complete control over
                    and need to learn the so-called "Finger tricks" in order to solve it most effectively.
