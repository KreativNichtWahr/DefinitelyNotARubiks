        <h2> What is this whole project about? (origins) </h2>
            <p>
                This project is part of the final exam of the informatics course at the DFGLFA, along with a written, purely theoretical exam and an oral presentation of this very project. The grade
                of each individual student does not directly depend on the quality of the project, but is rather attributed according to the student's capacities. It therefore relies almost exclusively
                on the student's progress throughout the year of preparation we are being given.
